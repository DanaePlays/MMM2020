# The Legend of Vernaccus


### main 1 (optional) > triggered by picking up book in Jobasha's
I found a book about a little known Daedra of great power. There was a map to a Shrine in the Sheogorad Region, not too far from Vas.

### main 5 > triggered when entering cave to shrine
I have found acave entrance leading to the Shrine of Vernaccus with difficulty: the place has clearly been deserted for a long time.

### main 10 > triggered when activating statue
Vernaccus spoke to me. He called me his champion though I have a nagging feeling heâ€™d call a rat his champion if a rat had walked in before me. He tasked me picking stones in and outside his shrines. That's a peculiar request to say the least.

### main 15 > triggered in dialogue with seducer outside shrine
Horavatha , a seducer talked to me as I was picking up stones outside the shrine. She quite plainly mocked me for serving Vernaccus and straight out said that he is in fact, rather puny. She even suggested I become her champion instead. She was joking though. I think? If I want to find her again, I should use the spell she taught me. It feels a little too easy... Meantime, I should speak with Vernaccus and find out more about "The Elusive Beast".

### book 1 (optional) > triggered by dialogue "Vernaccus with Seducer and booksellers
I was told of a book called "Vernaccus and Bourlor. It it is quite rare and might not be available at most bookshops.

### main 20 > triggered by statue script
Vernaccus wants me to expand and I quote "pimp his shrine", whatever that may mean. The Guardian of the Shrine will know what to do.

### cs 1  > triggered by statue script
One of the walls crumbled and revealed a new room: I can see a Well of Fire in its center. I think I also saw movement. I'd better investigate.

### cs 5 > triggered by Well of Fire lava / golem dialogue ????
The new room not only has a Well of Fire, but also a tall golem, the Guardian of the Shrine Vernaccus mentioned. The Well is quite clearly a connection to Oblivion and a source of power for Vernaccus.

### cs 10 > triggered by dialogue with Golem
I need to take a closer look at any of the crumbling walls in the shrine. I don't think the Golem will stop following me until I do.
### cs 15 > triggered when "First room" (with how to transmutate book) is built
The golem conjured a whole room using souls. I will need to get more souls if I want more rooms added. The room is very bare: it only has a book and a bottle of some sort. I assume both are very important.
### cs 20 > when any second room is built
I have managed to collect enough souls in the Bottle of Souls to have a second room built. It would seem that as long as I have collected enough souls, I can not only add rooms, but also unlock more objects. As amazing as the transmutation power is, it seems to be limited to the Shrine. I wonder...

### main 25 > triggered by statue script
Vernaccus wants to eat... Vivec. He seemed very serious about it too. Time to pay Horavatha a visit using the spell she gave me. If I don't like what she has to say, I can bring her flesh to Vernaccus.

### main 30 > triggered when reading note in H's Gauntlet
The spell Horvatha taught me took me... somewhere. I need to explore, survive and finally find Horvatha.

*PROF journal entries?*

### main 35 > dialogue with H
I have survived Horvatha's Gauntlet abd have therefore proven my worth to her.
She has given me a choice: follow her advice to somehow acquire Vernaccus' powers, or continue to serve Vernaccus

### main 40 > dialogue with H
I have decided to follow Horvatha's advice. According to her, I could gain great powers if I could re-enact Vernaccus's greatest moment: defeat Boulror.
As luck would have it, Bourlor's descendant has been destroying Vernaccus'shrines across Tamriel and should be heading to the last one here on Vvardenfell.

### main 50 > triggered by door script
The Shrine of Vernaccus is under attack, the Well of Power has dried up but I see no signs of an archer.There must be a way forward. Or downward?

### main 60 > On Hero death
Horvatha congratulated me. She claims I have *become* Vernaccus. That makes no sense. I should step through the portal and take a look at Vernaccus'statue again.
	OR...

### main 45 > dialogue with H
I have decided  to continue serving Vernaccus. Horvatha was dispeased, to say the least and attacked me.

### main 55 > triggered by door script
The Shrine of Vernaccus is under attack and the Well of Power has dried up. I must find the source of the disturbance. There must be a way forward. Or downward?

### main 65 > on hero death
Vernaccus congratulated me on deafeating the Archer hero. I should go through the portal and talk to Vernaccus again.

*MD journal entries?* (55 sided with H, 60 sided with V/killed Vivec)

### cs 100 (end1) > statue script
As far as I can tell, Vernaccus has vanished but I am feeling more powerful than ever, as though I was not channelling Vernaccus'power anymore, but I was Vernaccus myself. 
[You may use Transmutation anywhere in Tamriel.]

### cs 110 (end 2) > statue script
For my help saving the Shrine from Bourlor's descendant, Vernaccus has granted me the power to tranmutate outside the Shrine.
[You may use Transmutation anywhere in Tamriel.]
