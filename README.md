# The Legend of Vernaccus


### main 1 (optional)
I found a book about a little known Daedra of great power. There was a map to a Shrine in the Sheogorad Region, not too far from Vas.

### main 5
I have found acave entrance leading to the Shrine of Vernaccus with difficulty: the place has clearly been deserted for a long time.

### main 10
Vernaccus spoke to me. He called me his champion though I have a nagging feeling heâ€™d call a rat his champion if a rat had walked in before me. He tasked me picking stones in and outside his shrines. That's a peculiar request to say the least.

### main 15
Horavatha , a seducer talked to me as I was picking up stones outside the shrine. She quite plainly mocked me for serving Vernaccus and straight out said that he is in fact, rather puny. She even suggested I become her champion instead. She was joking though. I think? If I want to find her again, I should use the spell she taught me. It feels a little too easy... Meantime, I should speak with Vernaccus and find out more about "The Elusive Beast".

### book 1 (optional)
I was told of a book called "Vernaccus and Bourlor. It it is quite rare and might not be available at most bookshops.

### main 20
Vernaccus wants me to expand and I quote "pimp his shrine", whatever that may mean. The Guardian of the Shrine will know what to do.

### cs 1
One of the walls crumbled and revealed a new room: I can see a Well of Fire in its center. I think I also saw movement. I'd better investigate.

### cs 5
The new room not only has a Well of Fire, but also a tall golem, the Guardian of the Shrine, maybe?The Well is quite clearly a connection to Oblivion and a source of power for Vernaccus. The Golem must be the Guardian Vernaccus mentioned.

### cs 10
I need to take a closer look at any of the crumbling walls in the shrine. I don't think the Golem will stop following me until I do.
### cs 15
The golem conjured a whole room using souls. I will need to get more souls if I want more rooms added. The room is very bare: it only has a book and a bottle of some sort. I assume both are very important.
### cs 20
I have managed to collect enough souls in the Bottle of Souls to have a second room built. It would seem that as long as I have collected enough souls, I can not only add rooms, but also unlock more objects. As amazing as the transmutation power is, it seems to be limited to the Shrine. I wonder...

### main 25
Vernaccus wants to eat... Vivec. He seemed very serious about it too. It's either decide if he's actually serious, or use the scroll Horavatha gave me and see what she has to offer.
### main 30
The spell Horvatha taught me took me... somewhere. I need to explore, survive and finally find Horvatha.

*PROF journal entries?*

### main 35
I have survived Horvatha's Gauntlet abd have therefore proven my worth to her.
She has given me a choice: follow her advice to somehow acquire Vernaccus' powers, or continue to serve Vernaccus

### main 40
I have decided to follow Horvatha's advice. According to her, I could gain great powers if I could re-enact Vernaccus's greatest moment: defeat Boulror.
As luck would have it, Bourlor's descendant has been destroying Vernaccus'shrines across Tamriel and should be heading to the last one here on Vvardenfell.

### main 41
I have killed Vivec and obtained his flesh. Vernaccus will be pleased.
### main 51
The Shrine of Vernaccus is under attack but I see no sign of any archer. There must be a way forward. Or downward?

	OR...

### main 45
I have decided  to continue serving Vernaccus. Horvatha was dispeased, to say the least and attacked me.

### main 55
The Shrine of Vernaccus is under attack: I must find the source of the disturbance. There must be a way forward. Or downward?
	OR...

### cs 100 (end1)
As far as I can tell, Vernaccus has vanished but I am feeling more powerful than ever, as though I was not channelling Vernaccus'power anymore, but I was Vernaccus myself. 
[You may use Transmutation anywhere in Tamriel.]

### cs 110 (end 2)
For my help saving the Shrine from Bourlor's descendant, Vernaccus has granted me the power to tranmutate outside the Shrine.
