## QUESTLINE
1. The other book
- Find a book titled "The Legendary Elusive Beast" by V. Ernaccus
- Reading the book triggers a cutscene: There was a Daedra so mighty, so fearsome that he earned the titles of The Elusive Beast and The Unpursuable One! Molag Bal himself recognised my , ahemm, his power for I *cough * he is fearsome and mighty."
- Text in the book: "This book is badly written and goes on about the prowess of a Daedra called The Elusive Beast. The is a map indication the loaction of a Shrine, with the usual promise for glory and power."
- Map a la Xero

2.  The Shrine and the Statue
- The exterior of the shrine is pathetic (even for a ruin) and smaller than any other shrines on the continent
- The interior is a large cave with a large statue (think Molag Bal-ish, but surrounded by corpses)
- The Statue speaks and says:“My Champion, you have arrived at last! I am Vernaccus, the legendary Elusive beast, the Unpursuable One! Complete a task for me and you shall be rewarded richly. Heathens have thrown stones at my shrine, pick them up for me.Don't forget the one outside." 

OnActivate when picking up stone outside, H appears.
QUEST 0: PICK UP STONES around shrine
Seducer appears and mocks the player, gives hints about Vernaccus true nature (only 1 arrow!)
     ADD LINE: Vernaccus is so feeble even a mortal like you is more powerful
     ADD IDEA idea that you can come to her after you confront V
     
Journal entried REDO find shrine, mett H, V's second mission
> tooltips for the clutter in the shrine that show the place has never been great and has long been abandoned. Unusual amounts of stones

3.  Get a piece of the mayor
V is flustered we doubt him and tells us of this one time he single-handedly massacred a village and ate the Mayor
He want a suitable offering: the flesh of the most powerful mer in Morrowind: Vivec's
Journal: he must have lost his marble, H was right, we should find her in <RUIN>

4.  Horavatha
Ruin expansionto find her.
Give him ham, he won't know the difference

5.  Shrine again
- the statue is silent. A note says ”Gone hunting big game in Hircine’s Hunting Grounds. <USE MY ARTIFACT>  with a mortal soul, the more souls we capture, the more power.
V.
PS: Leave offerings by Shrine
Journal: I am starting to have my doubts about Vernaccus. I could try to use his artifact/spell , and maybe see if I can find anything about him: a Daedra with a shrine cannot be totally unknown.

6.  Finding the other book (optional)
- Player just goes shopping!
- we need to check how common the book is.

7.  Capture souls
- cast the spell on the KO npc
- spell effect woosh
- npc gone
- message box “The soul has been captured and sent to Vernaccus’ shrine.”

8.  Shrine again
- Daedric golem 'welcomes' the player
- it explains it was created from the soul we captured
- it explains how more souls will expand the shrine (“restore it to its former state, but better, hopefully)
- NEW: soul in pen, simple bedroom
9a. Pick a side
Conversation with V where our knowledge of H transpires.
 is enraged hearing H is currently on Nirm and wants her dead.
"She has be a thorn in my mighty side for far too long, speading lies about me, that jealous snake! 
And now, she uses her Seducer;s charm to turn you, my Champion, against me? Find her, kill her

9b. H congratulates us, we’d make a fine Vernaccus. Are we interested? 
Yes she tricked V into facing a hero, but his fall was his own undoing.
We (the player) would do MUCH better, in fact, by re-enacting V's finest moment, we could ascend and for all inten and purposes, become V, only smarter and stronger
YES: she tells us about Boulor's descendant
NO: we fight her and return to V
    V congratulates us andexplains that something is wrong with the shrine, a disturbance beneath and sends us to investigate

10. Facing the Hero
The hero is Bourlor's descendant who is on a quest to destroy all of Vernaccus' shrines across Tamriel. This is the last one. Because his ancestor died humiliated and he's seeking revenge. He shows up at the shrine and defiles the "Well of Fire" by messing up its roots deep in the earth. You have to go beneath the shrine into the caverns and kill him.

11. Shrine again
H side: she speaks of our new powers
V side: he gives us his greatest artifact

## Journal entries QUEST 1
### 1
I found a book about a little known Daedra of great power. There was a map to a Shrine in the Sheogorad Region. 
### 5
I have found a cave leading to the Shrine with difficulty: the place has clearly been deserted for a long time.
### 10
Vernaccus spoke to me. He called me his champion though I have a nagging feeling he’d call a rat his champion if a rat has walked in before me. He tasked me picking stones in and outside his shrines. That's a peculiar request to say the least.
### 11 (optional)
I was told there was a book titled "Vernaccus and Bourlor". It is pretty common in bookshops.
### 15
A seducer talked to me as I was picking up stones outside the shrine. She quite plainly mocked me for serving Vernaccus and hinted that he is in fact, rather puny. She even suggested I became her champion instead. If I want to find her again, I should travel to Assalkushalit, southeast of Maar Gan and on the northern side of Red Mountain, just inside the Ghostfence. In the meanwhile, I should speak with Vernaccus.
### 20
Vernaccus would not talk to me, he did however, leave a note (what sort of Daedra leaves notes?)I could not confront Vernaccus and ask him how he earned his title The Elsusive Beast, though I am starting to wonder if it's because he's never around whwn you need him.
At the very least, he's granted me a power that seems interesting. I should use it one someone who is incapacitated.
### 25
I have successfully captured a soul. The effect was quite spectacular and there was no body left. I can only assumed it's been moved to the Shrine or destroyed. I'd better return to the Shrine to find out. Maybe this time Vernaccus will deign answer my questions.
### 30
Vernaccus earned his titles of the Elusive Beast by dodging a thousand arrows. I doubt that's the story Horavatha the Seducer was refering to. Maybe I should look for information on Vernaccus, if shrines were built for him, there has got to be some records of his legend.
### 35
Vernaccus, eager to relive one of his most glorious times has asked me for a very specific offering: the flesh of Vivec. He seemed very serious about it too. Of all the reasons to commit , or maybe it is time to  see what Horavatha has to offer. She is in  Assalkushalit, southeast of Maar Gan.
### 40
Horavatha suggested I bring Vernaccus any meat as he won't be able to tell the difference. More importantly, she suggested I might gain some of Vernaccus' powers. She's also given me a Scroll of Mark in case I wanted to find her again quickly.
### 45
PICK SIDE


## Journal entries QUEST 2
### 1
There is a golem in the Shrine. He was able to communicate a surprising amount of information without saying a word: he seems to be animated by the power of the captured souls, he uses that power to dig tunnels. I should walk to any of the crumbling walls in the shrine and talk to the golem again.
### 5
It seems that I can instruct the golem to follow me to a crumbling wall where he will conjure a whole room. This process seems to require a number of souls, so I'll have to enthrall quite a few to see this shrine fully constructed.
